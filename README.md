# pyaps3
Python 3 Atmospheric Phase Screen

This python 3 module estimates differential phase delay maps due to the stratified atmosphere for correcting radar interferograms. It is rewritten in Python 3 language from PYAPS source code and adapted for ECMWF's ERA-5 corrections. 

Warning: PyAPS3 could not work with NARR and MERRA weather models. Feel free to modify these parts of the code.

## Installation

Add to your **_~/.bash_profile_** file for bash user:

```bash
##--------- PyAPS ------------------## 
export PYAPS_HOME=~/python/PyAPS
export PYTHONPATH=${PYAPS_HOME}:${PYTHONPATH}
```

Installing Python dependencies

```
mkdir PyAPS; cd PyAPS
git clone https://github.com/yunjunz/pyaps3.git

wget https://github.com/ecmwf/cdsapi/archive/v0.1.4.tar.gz -O cdsapi-0.1.4.tar.gz
tar -xvf cdsapi-0.1.4.tar.gz; cd cdsapi-0.1.4
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

## Account setup for global atmospheric models
### [ERA-5](https://retostauffer.org/code/Download-ERA5/)
ERA-5 data set is redistributed over the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), [create a new account](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register) on the CDS website if you don't own a user account yet. On the profile, you will find your user id (**UID**) and your personal **API Key**. Add the key to the `model.cfg` file as below:

```
#####key for ECMWF in Climate Data Store Application Program Interface
#Get it from https://retostauffer.org/code/Download-ERA5/
[CDS]
key = 1234:abcdefghij-134-abcdefgadf-82391b9d3f
```

where 1234 is your personal user ID (UID), the part behind the colon your personal API key. More details on CDSAPI can be found [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to).

Run `examples/TestECMWF.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook in your local machine to check if everything works.
